This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the useParams hook in React Router v6 with nested routes. The issue arises when attempting to access route parameters from a component that isn't directly within the route matching those parameters.  The solution provides a corrected implementation using the `useLocation` hook to access the URL and extract necessary parameters.
